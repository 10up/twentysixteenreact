# Twenty Sixteen React

Twenty Sixteen React is an isomorphic WordPress theme built using [NodeifyWP](https://github.com/10up/nodeifywp). The theme executes Node.js code directly in PHP utilizing the latest JavaScript technologies:

* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Redux](http://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
* [NodeifyWP](https://github.com/10up/nodeifywp/)


Twenty Sixteen React is a __true isomorphic application__ within PHP. It provides all the benefits of WordPress and powerful isomorphic Node.js technologies. No separate Node.js/Express server is necessary.
